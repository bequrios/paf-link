The **paf.link schema** has the goal of describing a RDF ([[[rdf11-concepts]]]) data schema for describing the activities of the public administration. As it is an activity based schema, it draws heavily on the [[[prov-o]]] which it extends with generic classes for public affaires. The paf.link schema supports not only the agents that make up the public administrations, but also their activities and the items that make up their activities. The paf.link schema allows to be adapted to actual public administrations by defining different application profiles (e.g. ch.paf.link).


[todo]Our ontology provides the foundations for implementation in a wide variety of applications, contexts, domains and forms of information. The structure presented here offers a broad framework for all activities inherent to the Federal Administration.
